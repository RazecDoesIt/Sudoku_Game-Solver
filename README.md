Sudoku Game (playable) and solver.


So, this is my first version (possible for a while) of attempting this monstruosity. I took this challenge when I started learning Python and it was a nightmare.
It still is. This code works, it's very fast and not too impossible to read and learn. It teached me a lot.


But what's the difference between this and any other code out there you may ask? Well, to be honest with whoever is reading this: none.
Other versions out there might be simpler and work better. But what made me do my own? Your game is never going to repeat itself.

Other versions made it way easier and simpler by using only one or two possible boards to play. My code build it's own board every single game.
Even if the chances of getting the same board ramdomly generated twice are low, I made it even lower by randomly deleting cells (which, by the way,
is tied to the difficulty selected) and making that even if you have more than one board possible, it'll be able to tell you if you are right or wrong.


And what are the flaws of my code?

-> you MUST NOT click on the numbers that already are on the board... I can't solve this for now and only God knows why.

-> it's poorly optimized, it runs smoothly, but it can perform even better with some optimization.


At least I hope that if you stumble upon this code and are struggling with anything related to it, may this help and teach you if it's possible.

This was definitely a very fun project and learning experience.

One day, in the far far future, I might re-do this, just to prove to my future and past self that I can.
