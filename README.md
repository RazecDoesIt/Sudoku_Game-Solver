Sudoku Game (playable) and solver.


So, this is my first version (possible for a while) of attempting this monstruosity. I took this challenge when I started learning Python and it was a nightmare.
It's still is. This code works, it's very fast and not too impossible to read and learn. It teached me a lot.


But what's the difference between this and any other code out there you may ask? Well, to be honest with whoever is reading this: none.
Other versions out there might be simpler and work better. But what made me do my own? Your game is never going to repeat itself.

Other versions made it way easier and simpler by using only one or two possible boards to play. My code build it's own board every single game.
Even if the chances of getting the same board ramdomly generated twice are low, I made it even lower by randomly deleting cells (which, by the way,
is tied to the difficulty selected) and making that even if you have more than one board possible, it'll be able to tell you if you are right or wrong.


This was definitely a very fun project and learning experience. I only learned the basics of arrays because of this.

One day, in the far far future, I might re-do this, just to prove to my future and past self that I can.
